Thermal Management and Cooling System for EVs: This project uses an Arduino Uno, DHT11 sensor, and OLED display to monitor battery temperature in electric vehicles. The system automatically activates cooling when temperatures are high and shuts off when safe levels are reached, ensuring optimal battery performance and safety.
